This project demonstrates the use of a very simple font chooser for iPhone OS devices.

The font chooser is implemented as a UITableViewController subclass with a delegate protocol for notification purposes.

Ideas for the future:
- add a filter, so only fonts are displayed that people may actually want to use
- sorting
